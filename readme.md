This is a demo application used for delivering a talk on [Spock](http://spockframework.org/) at [gr8conf EU](http://gr8conf.eu/).

The project is structured into three branches:
- _master_ contains a Java application with JUnit / JMock tests.
- _spock_ contains barebones Spock specifications used as a starting point for the demo.
- _spock-complete_ contains fully implemented Spock specifications for reference.
